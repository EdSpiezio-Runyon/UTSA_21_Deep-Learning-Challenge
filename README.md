# UTSA 21: Deep Learning Challenge

## Background
### Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization, wants to improve their process of selecting applicants for funding by predicting their success rate. The organization has provided a CSV file containing metadata of more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding in the past. Your task is to create a binary classifier that can predict whether an organization will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup using machine learning and neural networks.

## Technologies Used
#### - Python 3.7 or later
#### - Pandas
#### - Scikit-learn
#### - TensorFlow
#### - Keras

## Dataset
### The dataset provided by Alphabet Soup contains the following columns:
#### - EIN and NAME: Identification columns
#### - APPLICATION_TYPE: Alphabet Soup application type
#### - AFFILIATION: Affiliated sector of industry
#### - CLASSIFICATION: Government organization classification
#### - USE_CASE: Use case for funding
#### - ORGANIZATION: Organization type
#### - STATUS: Active status
#### - INCOME_AMT: Income classification
#### - SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS: Special considerations for application
#### - ASK_AMT: Funding amount requested
#### - IS_SUCCESSFUL: Whether the money was used effectively or not

## Instructions
#### 1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
#### 2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file AlphabetSoupChallenge.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
#### 3. Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame and preprocess the data.
#### 4. Use Scikit-learn to split the data into training and testing sets.
#### 5. Create a deep learning neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras.
#### 6. Train the model using the training dataset.
#### 7. Evaluate the model using the testing dataset.
#### 8. Tweak the model's hyperparameters to improve the accuracy if necessary.
#### 9. Save the final model as an h5 file.
#### 10. Test the model on new data.

## Conclusion
### By using machine learning and neural networks, you have created a binary classifier that can predict whether an organization will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. This tool will help the nonprofit foundation select applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.
